### Scope

Contributed as a Software Engineer to a pricing platform for a global energy enterprise. The app supported multiple regions with distinct pricing logic and business requirements.

### What I did

- Led the redesign of the navigation system and core pricing pages
- Developed modular, reusable components using Material UI
- Identified and resolved performance bottlenecks in React, improving responsiveness, especially on large-scale data tables
- Modernized legacy codebases and integrated backend-generated TypeScript types
- Maintained 100% test coverage for new features
- Used feature flags to manage region-specific logic and safely roll out new features

### Impact

- Improved UI consistency and accessibility across regions
- Reduced API requests by up to 50% through optimized data fetching and caching strategies
- Increased overall test coverage from ~70% to over 80%
- Shortened development cycles with a more maintainable codebase
- Helped ensure releases stayed predictable through agile collaboration

### Collaboration

- Collaborated with 8 cross-functional teams on architectural decisions to support a scalable and maintainable system
- Mentored junior developers via pair programming, code reviews, and shared design sessions
- Presented completed features in bi-weekly sprint reviews, improving stakeholder engagement and feedback loops
