### What I did

- Built reusable components with Material UI
- Resolved performance bottlenecks in React
- Maintained strong test coverage with 100 percent for new features and over 80 percent across the application
- Updated legacy code to modern standards using backend-generated types
- Helped streamline the development workflow by aligning frontend logic with backend schemas

### Impact

- Improved UI consistency and accessibility across regions
- Reduced frontend bugs through better type safety
- Shortened development cycles with a more maintainable codebase
- Helped ensure releases stayed predictable through agile collaboration

### Collaboration

- Worked closely with designers and backend developers to ensure a consistent experience
- Mentored junior developers through pair programming and code reviews
- Collaborated with other teams on architectural decisions to support a scalable and maintainable system
