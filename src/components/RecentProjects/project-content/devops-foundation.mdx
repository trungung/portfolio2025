### Scope

This internal application helps teams automate the creation and configuration of Azure DevOps projects. It streamlines onboarding and enables consistent project setup while ensuring security and cost visibility.

### What I did

- Developed end-to-end testing with Cypress
- Maintained 100% code coverage across the frontend
- Helped shape and implement the CI/CD pipeline for smoother deployment
- Collaborated with backend developers through pair programming and code reviews

### Impact

- Improved reliability and developer confidence through full test coverage and automation
- Enhanced user authentication and security through proper identity integration
- Reduced time and effort spent on manual project setup

### Collaboration

- Worked closely with backend engineers and product stakeholders during design and implementation
- Guided technical decisions within the frontend scope
- Shared knowledge through pair programming and peer reviews
