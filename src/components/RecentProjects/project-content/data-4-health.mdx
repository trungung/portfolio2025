cardDescription: "Award-winning simulation dashboard built for scientists that is fast, interactive, and mobile-friendly."
quickSummary: "I built an interactive dashboard to help scientists simulate cell cultures digitallyâ€”right from their laptop or phone. Our solution won first place at the EU's Data 4 Healthy Recovery Accelerator."

### Scope

This project was part of the Data 4 Healthy Recovery hackathon focused on smart health solutions across Europe. Our team set out to create a user-friendly tool that lets scientists run cell-culture simulations digitally, supporting both research and teaching. The tool needed to be interactive, accessible on desktop and mobile, and easy to use for non-technical users.

### What I did

- Designed and developed an interactive dashboard for running cell-culture simulations
- Optimized the UI to work smoothly across both desktop and mobile devices
- Collaborated with the team to understand scientific workflows and translate them into an intuitive interface
- Ensured the dashboard could visualize and respond to user input in real time

### Impact

- Our team was selected as the winning team in the _EU Data 4 Healthy Recovery Accelerator_
- Enabled easier experimentation and simulation without requiring lab access
