### Scope

Worked as a fullstack developer on a B2B venue and sales management platform used by both hotels and venue suppliers. The project focused on refreshing the core dashboard by improving usability, modernizing legacy code, and supporting a growing engineering team.

### What I Did

- Rebuilt key dashboard pages in React, starting with a new analytics view and later migrating parts of the legacy interface
- Set up server-side rendering to integrate React into a PHP and jQuery codebase without breaking existing functionality
- Maintained and improved legacy PHP and jQuery code to ensure stability during the transition
- Wrote and maintained backend logic with MongoDB and Redis, including data caching and performance improvements
- Helped integrate with external property management systems like Oracle and Mews
- Helped streamline CI/CD using Travis to support faster and more reliable releases

### Impact

- The platform won Top Hotel Management Software awards in both 2021 and 2022  
- Users praised the updated dashboard for being easier to use and more modern  
- The React migration helped reduce maintenance overhead and made it easier to onboard new developers  
- CI/CD improvements sped up the deployment process and reduced downtime risks

### Collaboration

- Paired with backend engineers to align data models and integrate features smoothly  
- Supported junior developers with code reviews and pair programming  
- Contributed to team planning and retrospectives to keep development goals on track
