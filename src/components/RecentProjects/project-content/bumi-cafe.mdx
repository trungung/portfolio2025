### Scope

This project started with another team, but due to delays and skill gaps, Bumi needed someone to step in quickly and get things done. I joined the project as a freelancer to help finish key parts of the website—both customer-facing and admin features—before launch.

### What I did

- Developed the About and Catering pages from scratch
- Fixed layout and styling issues across existing public pages
- Implemented new features for admin users to manage content more easily

### Impact

- Helped the team meet their launch deadline with a polished and functional site
- Improved visual consistency and user experience across the platform
- Enabled smoother admin workflows through new backend features

### Collaboration

- Coordinated closely with the Bumi team to align on priorities and deliverables
- Worked independently while keeping the team in the loop with regular updates
- Adapted quickly to an ongoing codebase and project context
