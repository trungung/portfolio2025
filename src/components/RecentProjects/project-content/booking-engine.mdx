### Scope

This project focused on improving the customer-facing booking experience for a white-label platform used by hotels and venues. I worked across the stack to streamline the booking flow, modernize legacy code, and enhance usability. I also built a lightweight widget that venue suppliers can embed directly into their own websites to enable seamless bookings.

### What I did

- Built and maintained booking pages using Vue.jsâ€”from front page to checkout and order management
- Improved booking flow efficiency through UI/UX updates and thoughtful design
- Maintained legacy PHP and jQuery codebases while ensuring performance and stability
- Contributed to backend features and integrations supporting the booking process

### Impact

- Improved user experience across the entire customer journey, from search to booking confirmation
- Helped modernize the tech stack while preserving compatibility with existing systems
- The platform was recognized for its innovation in venue booking on [HotelTechReport](https://hoteltechreport.com/meetings-and-events/venue-booking-platforms/meetingpackagecom-booking-engine)
- Trusted by major hotel groups like [Scandic Hotels](https://www.scandichotels.fi/) and [Nordic Choice Hotels](https://www.nordicchoicehotels.com/) through white-label partnerships

### Collaboration

- Worked closely with designers to implement clean and accessible UI updates
- Partnered with backend engineers to ensure smooth feature integrations
- Paired regularly with junior developers to share knowledge and review code
- Participated in agile planning and team retrospectives to align on goals
