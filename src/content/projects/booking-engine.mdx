  cardDescription:
    "A seamless venue booking flow, modernized for hotel chains across Europe.",
  quickSummary:
    "Modernized a white-label venue booking platform used by hotel chains across Europe. Improved the customer journey, refreshed the frontend, and supported backend features to make the platform faster, more usable, and easier to maintain.",
};

### Scope

Improved the customer-facing booking flow for a white-label platform used by hotels and venues. Focused on usability, modernizing legacy code, and building an embeddable widget for direct bookings on supplier websites.

### What I Did

- Built and maintained booking pages in Vue, from landing to checkout
- Created a lightweight widget for suppliers to embed on their own websites
- Improved booking flow and UI using Vuex, Bootstrap, and custom CSS
- Supported theming and branding needs across multiple white-label clients
- Contributed to backend features and integrations supporting the booking process

### Impact

- Improved the full customer journeyâ€”from landing page to booking confirmation
- Helped modernize the codebase while staying compatible with older systems
- Enabled easier customization for suppliers through flexible theming and branch support
- Platform was recognized for innovation on [HotelTechReport](https://hoteltechreport.com/meetings-and-events/venue-booking-platforms/meetingpackagecom-booking-engine)
- Trusted by leading hotel groups like [Scandic Hotels](https://www.scandichotels.fi/) and [Nordic Choice Hotels](https://www.nordicchoicehotels.com/) through white-label solutions

### Collaboration

- Partnered with backend developers to integrate features and fix issues quickly
- Shared knowledge with junior teammates through code reviews and pairing
