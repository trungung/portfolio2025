    "An internal application focused on secure Azure integration and testing automation.",
  quickSummary:
    "Led frontend development for a secure internal tool that automates Azure DevOps project setup. Focused on authentication, test coverage, CI/CD, and close collaboration with backend developers.",
};

### Scope

Built an internal tool that automates the setup of Azure DevOps projects. It helps teams onboard faster with consistent configurations, built-in security practices, and better visibility into project costs.

### What I Did

- Led the frontend architecture and helped shape the overall user experience
- Took the frontend from first lines of code to production-ready release
- Built a secure login flow using Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)
- Wrote end-to-end tests with Playwright to catch issues early
- Kept full test coverage across the frontend codebase
- Contributed to the CI/CD setup to make deployments smoother
- Paired regularly with backend developers for tight integration and faster feedback

### Impact

- Improved reliability and developer confidence through full test coverage and automation
- Enhanced user authentication and security through proper identity integration
- Reduced time and effort spent on manual project setup

### Collaboration

- Worked closely with backend engineers and stakeholders from design through delivery
- Led technical decisions for the frontend and helped keep things aligned across the team
- Shared knowledge through pair programming, code reviews, and everyday problem-solving
