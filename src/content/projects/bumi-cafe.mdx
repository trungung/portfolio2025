  cardDescription:
    "Helped Bumi launch fast by shipping critical pages and fixing core issues",
  quickSummary:
    "Stepped in as a freelancer to help Bumi launch on time after delays with the original team. Delivered two new pages, fixed styling issues across the site, and shipped admin features that improved internal workflows.",
};

### Scope

Bumi brought in extra support to get their site launch-ready after delays with an earlier team. The goal: finish key public and admin features quickly without compromising quality. The project needed someone who could jump in fast, work independently, and keep things moving.

### What I Did

- Built the About and Catering pages from the ground up
- Fixed layout and styling issues across existing public-facing pages
- Added new admin features to streamline content management

### Impact

- Delivered critical features in time for launch
- Boosted site consistency and user experience
- Improved internal workflows through clearer, easier admin tools

### Collaboration

- Worked directly with the Bumi team to align on goals and unblock progress
- Communicated regularly to stay synced while navigating an existing codebase and shifting priorities
