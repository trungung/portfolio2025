  cardDescription:
    "Award-winning interactive simulation dashboard built for scientists.",
  quickSummary:
    "Built an interactive, mobile-friendly dashboard that lets scientists simulate cell cultures digitally. Our solution won first place at the EU's Data 4 Healthy Recovery Accelerator.",
};

### Scope

Built a web-based tool to help scientists simulate cell cultures digitally. The goal was to support research and education by making simulation accessible without lab equipment â€” all from a browser, on any device.

### What I did

- Designed and built an interactive dashboard for configuring and running simulations
- Optimized layout and responsiveness for both desktop and mobile users
- Mapped scientific workflows into a clear, intuitive interface for non-technical users
- Implemented real-time input handling and dynamic visual feedback

### Impact

- Awarded first place in the EU's Data 4 Healthy Recovery Accelerator
- Enabled scientists and educators to simulate experiments outside the lab
- Made complex cell modeling more approachable and accessible
