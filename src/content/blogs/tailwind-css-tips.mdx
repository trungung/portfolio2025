## Use @apply for Repeating Patterns

If you find yourself repeating the same set of utility classes, consider using the `@apply` directive in your CSS:

```css
@layer components {
  .btn-primary {
    @apply focus:ring-opacity-75 rounded-lg bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 font-semibold text-white shadow-md hover:bg-blue-700 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-400 focus:outline-none;
  }
}
```

This creates a reusable component class that can be used in your HTML without the lengthy class names.

## Leverage JIT Mode

Tailwind's Just-in-Time mode generates styles on-demand rather than generating all possible utility classes at build time. This results in faster build times and smaller CSS files.

## Custom Variants with Tailwind 3.0

Tailwind 3.0 makes it easier than ever to create custom variants:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      screens: {
        tall: { raw: "(min-height: 800px)" },
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      // ...
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    // ...
  ],
};
```

Now you can use `tall:h-screen` to apply styles only when the viewport height is at least 800px.

## Content Configuration

Use the `content` configuration to tell Tailwind which files to scan for class names:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", "./public/index.html"],
  // ...
};
```

This ensures that Tailwind only generates the CSS you're actually using in your project.

## Conclusion

Tailwind CSS offers a powerful way to style your applications. By leveraging these tips and tricks, you can make your development process more efficient and your codebase more maintainable.
