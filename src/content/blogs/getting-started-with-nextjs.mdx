## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides a set of features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes to help you build production-ready React applications. It's developed and maintained by Vercel and has gained massive popularity in the React ecosystem.

## Why Use Next.js?

Here are some reasons why you might want to use Next.js for your next project:

- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js can render your pages on the server, which improves performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: You can pre-render pages at build time, making your site incredibly fast.
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints directly within your Next.js application.
- **File-based Routing**: Simply create files in the `pages` directory, and Next.js will handle the routing for you.
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Next.js has built-in support for CSS, SCSS, and CSS-in-JS solutions.

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

Navigate to your project and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

That's it! You now have a Next.js application running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

Next.js makes it easy to build modern web applications with React. Its features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and file-based routing make it a compelling choice for developers looking to build fast, SEO-friendly applications.
