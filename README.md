## 👋 Hello there!

Welcome to the codebase behind my personal slice of the internet. This portfolio isn't just a showcase of my work—it's a playground where I've implemented modern web technologies while telling my story as a developer.

I built this site with three goals in mind:

1. Create something visually engaging that still loads lightning-fast
2. Show off my code architecture and problem-solving approach
3. Make something that's genuinely fun to interact with

Feel free to explore the code, "borrow" any techniques you find interesting, or reach out if you want to chat about web development, collaborations, or job opportunities!

## ✨ Featured Projects

The portfolio showcases various projects I've worked on, from client work to personal experiments. Each project card reveals:

- Visual previews with interactive galleries
- Tech stack details and implementation highlights
- My role and the problems I solved
- Live links where available (some projects are under NDA)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Implementation

This site represents my technical philosophy: modern, performant, accessible, and maintainable code.

### Core Technologies

- **Next.js 15** with App Router, Server Components, and built-in optimizations
- **React 19** leveraging the latest hooks, patterns, and rendering optimizations
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with custom design system and utility extensions

### UI Components & Interactions

- Custom animations with **Framer Motion** including sequenced reveals
- **Radix UI** primitives for accessible interactive elements
- Responsive design with desktop-first approach but mobile-optimized experience
- Theme switching with system preference detection via `next-themes`

### Developer Experience

- Type-safe component props throughout
- Component composition patterns for reusability
- Performance optimizations for animations and image loading
- Accessibility baked in from the start, not tacked on later

### Fun Details

- Audio name pronunciation guide
- "Minimal mode" toggle for users who prefer simpler interfaces
- Reduced motion support for those with vestibular disorders
- Easter eggs hidden throughout the site (can you find them all?)
